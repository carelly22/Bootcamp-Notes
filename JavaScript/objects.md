## Objects

### Intro

Objects are a way to store different pieces of information in a single data structure while maintaining a descriptive naming scheme. Specifically, **objects** are a collection of properties bounded by curly braces ({}), similar to a has in Ruby. These properties can point to values of any data type - even other objects.
