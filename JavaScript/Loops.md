# Intro to Loops

## Objectives

- Build a for loop
- Build a while loop
- Build a do-while loop
- Explain the purpose of a loop
- Explain the difference between each type of loop in JS

## About Loops

- Loops are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times

Example of loops:

- for loops
- while loops
- do-while loops

## The `for` loop

### Syntax of a for loop

```
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration])
{
    [loopBody];
}
```

### Syntax Defintions

1. **initialization** - an expression (including assignment epressions) or variable declaration. This is typically used to initialize a counter variable. May optionally declare new variables with the var keyword.

2. **condition** - an expression evaluated before each loop iteration; if this expression evaluates to true, the statement is executed

3. **iteration** - this statement is executed at the end of each iteration; usually involves incrementing or decrementing a counter, bringing the loop closer to ending

4. **loopBody** - code which runs on every iteration as long as the condition evaluates to true
