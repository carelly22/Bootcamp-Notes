# REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)

* **Read** whatever I just wrote
* **Evaluate** it
* **Print** it 
* **Loop** returning control to the user and wait to be asked to read the next line

**NB** : console.log is an example of REPL

## Syntax

* Semicolons
  - You don't have to use semicolons
  - If you are using them, you should be consistent!

* camelCase
  - JS variables and function names are written using camel case - the first letter of the first word is lowercase, the first letters of subsequent words are written in uppercase; no punctuation or spaces between words
  - **Example** : `var pizzaTopping = "pepperoni";`

## Numbers 

* The number data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals
* Entering a number into the console will return it right back to you

## Arithmetic Operations

* You can perform calculations with number easily - just type out the expression the way you would type it in a calculator
* **Example** : `3 + 2.1`

## Comparing Numbers

* You can compare numbers to see if one's greater than, less than, or equal to another (in either the console or in a program)
* **Example** : `5 > 10` will return false
