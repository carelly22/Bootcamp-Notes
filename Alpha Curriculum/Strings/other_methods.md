# Other String Methods

Strings share several other methods with arrays, including `length`, `reverse` (and `reverse!`), `empty?`, `include?`, and `index`:

```ruby
"How many characters do I have?".length #=> 30

"stressed".reverse #=> "desserts"

"".empty? #=> true
"full".empty? #=> false

"".include?("f") #=> false
"full".include?("f") #=> true

"full".index("u") #=> 1
"full".index("ll") #=> 2
```

The `delete` and `count` methods behave slightly differently for strings.` delete` does not modify string receivers, and `count` must receive an argument when used with strings (`count` only counts occurrences of the substring and is not synonymous with `length`).` delete` has a dangerous version just for strings: `delete!`. `delete` deletes any characters that appear in its argument.

```ruby
sad_string = "full of emptiness"
sad_string.delete("e") #=> "full of mptinss"
sad_string #=> "full of emptiness"

sad_string.delete(" of emptiness") #=> "ull" ("f" appears in the argument)
sad_string #=> "full of emptiness"

sad_string.delete!("of emptiness") #=> "ull"
sad_string #=> "ull"
"f" + sad_string #=> "full" :)

sad_string = "full of emptiness"
sad_string.count("e") #=> 2
```
